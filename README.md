### Instructive Study Guide

### **1: The Foundations (Use Griffiths)**

**Chapters 1–3.** Griffiths is much more conversational. Use it to understand the *physics* of why we use the Delta function and how the Scalar Potential works. It covers everything in your first 3 pages of notes beautifully. If you feel "lost" about the conceptual side, start here.

### **2: The Math Heavy-Lifting (Use Jackson)**
* **Chapters 2 & 3.** Your notes on the **Rectangular Box** and **Legendre Polynomials** (Spherical Shells)  lean toward the mathematical rigor found in Jackson.
* **Specific Advice:** Read Jackson Section 3.1–3.3 for the spherical problems. He goes into more detail on the "Orthogonality of Legendre Polynomials" which appears frequently in your notes.

### **3: Solving the Problems**
* **The "Trick":** For the multipole expansion, Jackson’s Chapter 4 is the gold standard. Since you are interested in **nanophotonics**, pay close attention to the **Dipole term**, as that is how atoms interact with light in quantum optics.

### **4: For the "Math" of Green's Functions (Use Jackson)**
* Griffiths barely touches Green's Functions, but your notes  follow Jackson’s **Chapter 1 (Sections 1.8–1.10)** almost exactly.
* **Focus:** Understanding the identity   is the "magic key" for this entire section.

### *5: For Dielectrics & Magnetostatics (Start with Griffiths)**
* **Chapters 4, 5, and 6.** Griffiths is excellent at explaining the difference between "Free" and "Bound" charges/currents.
* **Note 2 Application:** Use Griffiths Chapter 4 to understand your notes on the dielectric shell and Chapter 6 for the "Magnetization" problems .

### **6: For Time-Varying Fields & Skin Depth (Use Jackson/Griffiths)**
* **The Skin Effect:** Your notes deal with the **Magnetic Diffusion Equation**.
* **Jackson Section 5.18** (and Chapter 8) is better for the rigorous "Bessel Function" solutions  you see on page 35 of Notes 2.
* **Griffiths Section 9.4** is a friendlier introduction to why the field decays as .
